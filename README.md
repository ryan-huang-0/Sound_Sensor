This [library](https://github.com/ryan-huang-0/Sound_Sensor/blob/main/ei-sound-detection-project-v6-arduino-1.0.10.zip) must be added to the Arduino IDE sketch by going to:

Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library

before flashing to the device. This is the compressed .zip file for the sound detection inference model.
